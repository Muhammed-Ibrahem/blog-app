# Hello & Welcome

## **[LIVE DEMO ðŸš€](https://simulate-blog-app.netlify.app/)**

**This application is a simple blog, something like Medium and Dev the idea was inspired from fireship.io who inspired it from those 2 websites**

In order to create a cool post you can use **`Markdown`** for good visualisation or you can just wanna test things out you can write anything it won't matter

In this project I used React.js and Firebase to learn the basic **CRUD** operations and also **Firebase Authentications**

**The App Requires a user to be authenticated in order to publish his posts and interact with his/others posts**

Each User has his own **Profile-Page** that shows his **posts**, and an **(admin-like) page** that make him able to create to posts and also has quick access to know if his posts are **Live or not**, and give the user the ability to **edit** his posts and within the **Edit Page** user can **Delete** his post

**In this application I used React.js to build the UI & **For the routing part I used `React-Router-DOM`**, then for auth and data I used Firebase Authentication to Authenticate users and firebase Real-time database to store the Data**
